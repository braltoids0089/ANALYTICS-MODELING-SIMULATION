        "\n",
        "The project is \" UAE Energy and Climate Dashboard\" covering the years 2019-2024. The funcion is to provide a visual dashboard for exploring energy and climate data related to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by integrating climate and energy data. This is achieved by visualizing historical trends in climate variables (temperature, precipitation) and energy metrics (natural gas, biofuels, hydrocarbons).\n",
